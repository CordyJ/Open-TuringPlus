This is the root directory of the source for the Turing Plus run-time support library (TL).

The sub-directories are:

TL: machine-independent sources and interfaces to machine-dependent code
doc: documentation

The other sub-directories contain machine-specific overrides and implementations for the named machine.

To compile the library go to the machine-specific directory and use "make".
