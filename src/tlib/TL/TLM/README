This directory contains the machine-independent implementations of the
Turing Plus kernel concurrency support library routines.

The various routines are as follows:

TLM.ch		(internal)
	The TLM parent module.

TLMUDUMP.ch	(OutputState)
	This process prints out a dump of the state of all processes
	blocked in or waiting on a monitor and its conditions.

TLMCDSIG.ch	(pDeferredSignal)
	This routine performs a "signal" on a deferred condition.

TLMCDWT.ch	(pDeferredWait)
	This routine performs a "wait" on a deferred condition.

TLMCDINI.ch	(pDeferredConditionInitialize)
	This routine performs the initialization of a deferred condition
	required for its definition.

TLMCEMP.ch	(pEmpty)
	This routine implements the "empty" function.

TLMCLEN.ch       (length of condition queue)
	A fuction to return the length of the wait queue.
	(used experimentally for now - could become part of language later)

TLMCPSIG.ch	(pPrioritySignal)
	This routine performs a "signal" on a priority condition.

TLMCPWT.ch	(pPriorityWait)
	This routine performs a "wait" on a priority condition.

TLMCPINI.ch	(pPriorityConditionInitialize)
	This routine performs the initialization of a priority condition
	required for its definition.

TLMCRSIG.ch	(pSignal)
	This routine performs a "signal" on a regular condition.

TLMCRWT.ch	(pWait)
	This routine performs a "wait" on a regular condition.

TLMCRINI.ch	(pConditionInitialize)
	This routine performs the initialization of a regular condition
	required for its definition.

TLMRENT.ch	(pEnterMonitor)
	This routine performs the exclusive access required to enter a
	regular monitor.

TLMREXT.ch	(pExitMonitor)
	This routine is called when a process leaves a regular monitor.

TLMRINI.ch	(pInitializeMonitor)
	This routine performs the initialization of a regular monitor
	required for its definition.

TLMCTSIG.ch	(pTimeOutSignal)
	This routine performs a "signal" on a timeout condition.

TLMCTWT.ch	(pTimeOutWait)
	This routine performs a "wait" on a timeout condition.

TLMCTINI.ch	(pTimeOutConditionInitialize)
	This routine performs the initialization of a timeout condition
	required for its definition.

TLMDENT.ch	(pEnterDeviceMonitor)
	This routine performs the exclusive access required to enter a
	device monitor.

#if removed then
 /* these have been moved to TLK */
TLMDEXT.ch	(pExitDeviceMonitor)
	This routine is called when a process leaves a device monitor.

TLMDINI.ch	(pInitializeDeviceMonitor)
	This routine performs the initialization of a device monitor
	required for its definition.

TLMIPINI.ch	(pInitializeInterruptProcedure)
	This routine performs all necessary initialization of an
	interrupt procedure.

TLMIPEXT.ch	(pInterruptProcedureExit)
	exit from device procedure

TLMPFORK.ch	(pStartProcess)
	This routine is responsible for starting a new process from a
	"fork" statement.  It calls TLMCZ to perform the machine-dependent
	initialization.

TLMPPGET.ch	(pGetPriority)
	This routine returns the current process' dispatch priority.

TLMPPSET.ch	(pSetPriority)
	This routine sets the current process' dispatch priority.

TLMPPAU.ch	(pPause)
	This routine implements the "pause" statement.

TLMTROUT.ch	(pLoopTimeSlice)
	This routine is called at the top of every loop to possibly
	cause a context switch.

TLMTLOOP.ch	(pRoutineTimeSlice)
	This routine is called at the top of every procedure to possibly
	cause a context switch.
