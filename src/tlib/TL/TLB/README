This directory contains the machine-independent implementations of the
Turing Plus buffer memory management library routines.

The various routines are as follows:

TLB.ch		(internal)
	The TLB parent module.

TLBALL.ch	(pAllocate)
	This routine is responsible for allocating memory for flex arrays.

TLBDAL.ch	(pDeAllocate)
	This routine is responsible for releasing memory allocated by TLBALL.

TLBFRC.ch	(pFreeChecked)
	This routine is responsible for free'ing checked collection elements
	allocated by TLBNWC.

TLBFRU.ch	(pFree)
	This routine is responsible for free'ing unchecked collection elements
	allocated by TLBNWU.

TLBMAL.ch	(MemoryAllocate)
	This routine is called by all allocation routines to perform the 
	actual memory allocation.

TLBMFR.ch	(MemoryDeallocate)
	This routine is called by all de-allocation routines to perform the 
	actual memory de-allocation.

TLBNWC.ch	(pNewChecked)
	This routine is responsible for new'ing a new checked collection
	element.

TLBNWU.ch	(pNew)
	This routine is responsible for new'ing a new unchecked collection
	element.

TLBUNR.ch
	This routine is the worker for uninitialization.  It interprets a
	language designed for uninitializing variables.

TLBUNI.ch	(pUninitializeVariable)
	This routine just calls TLBUNR.

TLBUUN.ch	(pUninitializeUnion)
	This routine is used by the tag statement.  It uninitializes the
	proper alternative of the union.  Calls TLBUNR.
