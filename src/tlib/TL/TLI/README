TLIRE.ch	(pRead)
	This routine performs a "read" with no status return.

TLIRER.ch	(pReadResult)
	This routine performs a "read" with a status return.

TLISF.ch	(pSetFileInfo)
	Set the "info" field for a given stream number.

TLISK.ch	(pSeek)
	This routine performs a "seek" to an absolute location.

	This routine specifies the standard input stream for upcoming
	I/O operations.

TLISSO.ch	(pSetStreamToStdout)
	This routine specifies the standard output stream for upcoming
	I/O operations.

TLISSS.ch	(pSetStreamAndStatus)
	This routine specifies the stream for upcoming I/O operations,
	and specifies the location for status returns.

TLITL.ch	(pTell)
	This routine implements the "tell" statement.

TLIWR.ch	(pWrite)
	This routine performs a "write" with no status return.

TLIZ.st		(TLI Initialize)
	The machine-dependent body of this stub should set up the I/O
	subsystem, including setting the stream information for parameters
	and standard input/output/error.
